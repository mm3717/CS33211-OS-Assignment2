=============================================

TOPIC: Banker's Algorithmn

Considering a system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. Implement the Banker’s algorithm to answer the following question： Is the system in a safe state? If Yes, then what is the safe sequence?

=============================================

DESCRIPTION

The project consists of 1 c++ file, 1 .txt file,  1 documentation pdf, and 1 runtime-example-with-debug.png. This implementation of Dijkstra's "Banker's" algorithm utilizes 1D and 2D arrays with nested for-loop code segments to evaluate multi-round resource availability. Correspondingly, libraries related to those functions are included. The project was primarily developed in vscode and tested on KSU wasp/hornet servers.
